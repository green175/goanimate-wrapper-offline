### What do I care about
The character folder is now compressed, resulting in MUCH smaller file sizes. This changelog exists so it's easy to see what was changed in each update. The character creator goes to the video list after saving.

  - HTTPS cert updated with contact email, proper name, and being valid for both 127.0.0.1 and localhost
  - Extra CMD windows are now hidden (unless in verbose mode)
		- To do this, the utilities folder has scripts to launch Node.js and http-server individually
  - Launcher title shows what stage it's in
  - HTML page files reorganized
